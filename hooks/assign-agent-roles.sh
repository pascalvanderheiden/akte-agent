# Apply least-privilege data-plane roles to the Foundry hosted-agent instance
# identity by deploying the declarative Bicep module
# infra/modules/agent-role-assignments.bicep.
#
# Why a hook is still required even though the roles live in IaC
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# A Foundry hosted agent (`host: azure.ai.agent`) runs under its own managed
# "AgentIdentity" service principal, created by `azd ai agent deploy` AFTER
# `azd provision` has already run the main Bicep deployment. A Bicep role
# assignment needs a principalId that already exists, so the agent identity
# cannot be referenced during provisioning.
#
# This hook performs the ONE thing Bicep cannot do — a Microsoft Entra ID lookup
# of the runtime-created agent identity — and then hands the resolved
# principalIds to the Bicep module, which declares the actual role assignments.
# The role *definitions, scopes and types* therefore live in IaC, not in shell.
#
# Idempotent and best-effort: re-running is safe (Bicep assignment names are
# deterministic), and failures are reported without aborting the deploy.
#
# Requirements: the deploying principal must be able to create role assignments
# (Owner or "User Access Administrator") — the same right `azd provision` already
# relies on for the Bicep role assignments.
